title: Triple Triad Remake Project

For one of my first projects to get my feet wet in the process of game development I have decided to remake one my favorite mini-games. The card game in Final Fantasy 8, Triple Triad, has kept my attention for far longer than the actual game has. I have spent more time collecting cards than beating down the enemies in the game. 

Since I knew a lot about the game from my experiences playing it, I decided to attempt a complete recreation of it from the ground up. To achieve this goal I decided to use the Unity game creation engine, even though I had minimal experience with programs of its type.
